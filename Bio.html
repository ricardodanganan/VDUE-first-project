            <p> 
              Paul is from Clondalkin. Born in 2002, he was exposed to computers and technology 
              from a very young age from his brothers and sisters use of them consistently and 
              was fascinated by them ever since. The first computer he used was an iMac G3 in 2005-2006 
              and has been interested in older and newer computers since then. 
              He now likes to collect older game consoles and computers whenever he can. 
              He wished to be an artist/illustrator originally and wanted to go to an art college, 
              but due to personal reasons he chose a computing course as his subject. 
              He does not regret his decision as he now gets to learn about one of his favorite past-time hobbies.

              As a long time, gamer and JRPG fanatic, he is devoted himself to playing good story rich RPG games.

            <p>
              Born in Tallaght, I love prog rock, hanging out with friends, and competitive fps games. 
              Extremely competitive and always looking to improve, I push myself to be the best 
              I can at everything I do. I took up computing because I’ve always had an 
              interest in creating video games. I love creating things and problem solving has 
              always been fun for me. These factors pulled me toward the course and have kept 
              me motivated through the first semester.

            </p>
            <p>
              Robbie was born in Dublin, Ireland in 2003. 
              As a kid growing up in the early 2000s, he was exposed to a lot of media in the form of mostly video games. 
              He always looked up to Youtubers who played games for fun and was fascinated about the world building of video games
              that made them so immersive and allowed for hours upon hours of gameplay. 
              The main games that he played were JRPGs like Pokémon, Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy etc. 
              He took up a programming course so that he can learn about the different types of media and how we can program to help other people
              in our everyday lives – much like how video games have helped motivate him and have fun.

            <p>
              Born in Carlow, I grew up playing with Lego and any video games I could lay my hands on. I played any genre I could find from 
              simple platformers to FPS games to RPG’s. It was with FPS and RPG’s where I found my true passion and I’ve played these genres
              ever since. My passion for gaming as well as my desire to build things led me to choose this course because 
              I wanted to give other people an experience like mine and despite the difficulty I’ve had with some of the modules 
              I’m still just as motivated to stick with this course
